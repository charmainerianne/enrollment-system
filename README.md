# Enrollment System

## Project Overview
The Enrollment System is a web application designed to manage and facilitate the enrollment process for students. This application provides a user-friendly interface for both administrators and students to handle the enrollment functionalities efficiently, ensuring smooth operations and user experience.

## Installation
To set up the Enrollment System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enrollment-system.git
   cd enrollment-system
   ```

2. **Set up the database**:
   Ensure you have SQL Server installed. The application uses **LocalDB** to manage database connections. Create a database that the application can connect to.

3. **Configure the application**:
   Modify the `appsettings.json` file to ensure that the connection string points to your database as needed. The default is set up for LocalDB.

4. **Install dependencies**:
   If using .NET Core, run this command to restore packages:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   You can start the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access it via your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:5000`. Use the various interfaces to manage enrollments, student data, and other functionalities provided.

## Features
- User-friendly enrollment management.
- Secure data handling with role-based access.
- Comprehensive logging of events and operations.
- Configurable connection strings to adapt to different environments.

## Dependencies
The dependencies for this project can be found in the `package.json` file, which might include various .NET packages primarily used for web applications and database management. Be sure to install the necessary packages by running the package manager commands mentioned above.
